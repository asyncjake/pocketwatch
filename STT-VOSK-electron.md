# QUESTION: how STT, vosk?

Sweet! Now lets make it a headache - lets say I want my electron app to have a button that runs speech-to-text and saves the text in a variable, which would be saved with the current system time in said variable, and I want a button that saves that variable at the user's request. Is there a good nodejs library I can package with my app to make this work? Or should I install another service like vosk? The only HARD requirements about speech-to-text is that it runs on the current default input device, and that it runs entirely on the localhost machine

# ANSWER | PHIND-34B MODEL

To implement speech-to-text functionality in your Electron app that runs entirely on the localhost machine and uses the current default input device, you have a couple of options. Given your requirements, using a Node.js library that can be packaged with your app is a good approach. One such library is Vosk, which is an offline speech recognition toolkit that supports multiple languages and can run entirely on the user's machine.

## Using Vosk for Speech-to-Text
Vosk is a powerful library that can be used for speech recognition tasks without the need for an internet connection, making it suitable for your requirements. Here's a basic outline of how you can integrate Vosk into your Electron app:

Install Vosk: First, you need to install Vosk. Since Vosk is a native module, you'll need to compile it for Electron. You can use electron-rebuild to rebuild the native modules for Electron.
```
npm install vosk
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
```

## Implement Speech-to-Text
Use Vosk to capture audio from the default input device, convert it to text, and save it in a variable.
```
const { dialog } = require('electron').remote;
const fs = require('fs');
const Vosk = require('vosk');

// Initialize Vosk with the model
const model = new Vosk.Model('path/to/your/model');
const recognizer = new Vosk.Recognizer(model);

// Function to start speech recognition
function startSpeechRecognition() {
    // Capture audio from the default input device
    // This part depends on how you capture audio in Electron
    // You might need to use a library like `node-record-lpcm16`
    // and then feed the audio data to Vosk
}

// Function to process the captured audio
function processAudio(audioData) {
    const result = recognizer.acceptWaveform(audioData);
    const text = result.text;
    // Save the text in a variable
    // You can then use this variable to save the text at the user's request
}

// Function to save the text
function saveText(text) {
    // Use the dialog and fs modules to save the text as shown in the previous example
}
```

Capture Audio: Capturing audio in Electron can be challenging because it doesn't provide a built-in API for this. You might need to use a library like node-record-lpcm16 to capture audio from the default input device. This library captures audio in the LPCM format, which you can then feed into Vosk.
User Interface: Implement buttons in your Electron app's UI to start speech recognition and save the text. You can use the dialog module to show a save dialog when the user wants to save the text.

Alternative: Artyom.js
Another option is to use Artyom.js, a library that provides a simple interface for speech recognition and synthesis. However, Artyom.js relies on the Web Speech API, which might not meet your requirement of running entirely on the localhost machine. It's more suitable for web applications rather than Electron apps that require offline functionality.

Given your requirements, Vosk is the more appropriate choice. It allows for offline speech recognition and can be packaged with your Electron app, ensuring that it runs entirely on the user's machine without needing an internet connection.

# QUESTION: how package model

Dope! I know that vosk requires an external model file for language recognition, how would I bundle that external file with my electron app? Does the above approach cover this need or is there some other trick I need to do to ship the model with the app binary?

# ANSWER | PHIND-34B MODEL

To bundle the Vosk model file with your Electron app, you need to ensure that the model file is included in your app's package and that it's accessible at runtime. The approach to include the model file in your Electron app involves a few steps, considering the need to handle native addons and the specifics of Electron's packaging system.

## Step 1: Include the Model in Your Project
First, place the Vosk model file in a directory within your project. For example, you might create a directory named assets/models and place your model file there.

## Step 2: Adjust Your package.json
To ensure that the model file is included in your Electron app's package, you need to adjust the build configuration in your package.json. This involves specifying the files to be included in the build. You've already seen an example of how to do this in the provided sources:

```
"build": {
 "files": [
    "dist/**/*",
    "src/assets/icons/*",
    "electron.js",
    "package.json",
    "assets/models/*",
    "node_modules/vosk/lib/*"
 ]
}
```
This configuration ensures that the model files and the necessary Vosk library files are included in the build.

## Step 3: Handling Native Addons
As mentioned in the sources, Electron apps that use native addons (like Vosk) need to ensure that these addons are correctly packaged and accessible at runtime. This involves handling .node files, which are native addons. The solution is to deploy native addons used by your project to the same directory as the executable. This can be achieved by copying the necessary .node files to the root folder of your packaged app or ensuring they are included in the build process.

For example, if you're using electron-builder or electron-packager, you might need to adjust your build scripts to ensure that the .node files are correctly placed in the output directory. This might involve custom scripts or additional configuration options provided by these tools.

## Step 4: Accessing the Model at Runtime
When your app is running, you'll need to ensure that the path to the model file is correctly resolved. This might involve using a relative path or dynamically determining the path based on the app's runtime environment.

For example, if you've placed your model in assets/models, you might access it like this:

```
const model = new Vosk.Model('./assets/models/your-model-file');
```

### Additional Considerations

Dynamic Linking Errors: If you encounter dynamic linking errors (as mentioned in the sources), this might indicate issues with how the native addons are being packaged or accessed. Ensure that the .node files are correctly placed and accessible at runtime.
Platform-Specific Considerations: The process for handling native addons and packaging your app might vary depending on the target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). Ensure that your build configuration and scripts account for these differences.
By following these steps and considering the specifics of your project's setup, you should be able to bundle the Vosk model file with your Electron app and ensure that it's correctly included and accessible at runtime
