    Bugs with phind
    attempts at hotkeys with phind, beginning the descent into madness
    Tried secure, insecure, varied configurations, preload hacks, rituals
    Nothing worked

various dates:
    2-3 more AI sessions, never got it working, hope is lost
    maybe i should find another framework? wails and go, to go with the wailing in my heart? i'm too disheartened, go is too smart for me

april 5:
    another ai session just one more it's gotta work this time i know it will
    delusion fades, i remember there's documentation
    one trip to the electron site and i started to remember who i was
    within the hour i was alive again
    AND THE HOTKEYS WORK!
    seems gpt was not aware of the way electron manages IPC, just what the code kinda looks like. EXTREMELY helpful in some cases! Absolutely not in this case! gg ai, RIP my last brain cell
