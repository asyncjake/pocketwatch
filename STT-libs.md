FOSSPOST SAYS
What is the Best Open Source Speech Recognition System?

If you are building a small application that you want to be portable everywhere, then Vosk is your best option, as it is written in Python and works on iOS, android and Raspberry pi too, and supports up to 10 languages. It also provides a huge training dataset if you shall need it, and a smaller one for portable applications.
